## Getting Started
thank you more taking your time to review my project !

### Prerequisites

I recommend to already have "MySqlWorkbench" downloaded to better acess the SQL data and the sample data, as well as having an account on (dbdiagram) https://dbdiagram.io/home to acess the ER model

## Usage

The main use of my project is to create a database that holds data on prayers like a social media network, were users can create, like, and save prayers made by themselves, or other online creators. This database is meant to model an effective way to store the data and to allow for users to like and save more than one prayer.

## Database Structure

My main scruture in an ER diagram, which is labeled "ER Diagram". I have provided a script along with it that contain notes on the keys, and the cardinalities of the data.

## Sample Data
The sample data has been included in the "Table Data" folder, containing 14 rows of sample data for each table. 

## Additional Sections

- If it is at all helpful, I have also provided a folder containing SQL text in regards to each table. The folder is called "Table SQL files"
- in case this read me cannot be opened through Github, I will be adding it to my file as well.
